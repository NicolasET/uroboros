# Changelog

## 0.1.0 — 2026-07-10

Initial open-source release.

- `/uroboros:run` orchestrator: intake → branch → six SDD phases with auto-advance, per-feature `loop-state.md`, resume check, hard verification gate on implement, legible final Loop Report.
- `uroboros-reviewer` subagent: fresh-context, read-only, zero-inference interrogation per phase profile; `CLEAN` requires positive evidence.
- `uroboros-implementer` subagent: fresh-context maker; model + effort chosen by the user at runtime via a blocking question; reports `BLOCKED` on ambiguity instead of guessing.
